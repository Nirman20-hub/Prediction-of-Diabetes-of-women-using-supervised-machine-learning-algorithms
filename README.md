# Prediction-of-Diabetes-of-women-using-supervised-machine-learning-algorithms
Definition of the Problem: Predicting whether a womenh as diabetes or not based on various clinical aproved features.

Data Collection: Dataset contains features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, etc., along with corresponding labels indicating whether the individual has diabetes or not. Datasets has been sourced from Kaggle.

Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values: Checked and imputed missing data.
Imputed zero values

Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Model Selection:
Perfored logistic regression for binary classification of diabetes
Model Training: Trained the selected models on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.

Results:
The accuracy of the model is 80 percent and auc curve showed that model has well performed but further optimization can be done to increase the model accuracy.
Further Scope:

Hyperparameter Tuning: We can further optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve performance. Techniques like grid search or random search can be employed for this purpose.

Model Validation:
We can further validate the final model on the test dataset to ensure its generalization performance.
Perform additional checks such as assessing the model's robustness and fairness.
