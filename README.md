# Prediction-of-Diabetes-of-women-using-supervised-machine-learning-algorithms
Definition of the Problem: Predicting whether a person has diabetes or not based on various clinical aproved features.

Data Collection: Dataset contains features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, etc., along with corresponding labels indicating whether the individual has diabetes or not. Datasets has been sourced from Kaggle.

Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values: Checked and imputed missing data.
Normalize/Standardize data: Scale numerical features to a similar range.
Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Feature Selection/Engineering:

Identify relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction task.
Perform feature engineering if necessary, such as creating new features based on domain knowledge.
Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Model Selection:

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks. Common choices include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, etc.
Experiment with different algorithms and evaluate their performance.
Model Training: Train the selected models on the training data.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.
Utilize techniques like cross-validation for robust evaluation.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve performance. Techniques like grid search or random search can be employed for this purpose.

Model Validation:

Validate the final model on the test dataset to ensure its generalization performance.
Perform additional checks such as assessing the model's robustness and fairness.
